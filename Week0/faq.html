<b>Orientation</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: When will 
the course start?
<br>&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: How do I access the 
course materials?
<br>&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>HW</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: I selected a correct answer for a question. Why I did not get any points for 
that?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A: HW uses multiple-choice 
questions. The tricky part is that you do not know how many entries you should 
choose for a given question. You are expected to pick ALL correct answers for 
each question. If you miss a correct answer, you get zero point for that entry. 
If you pick a wrong answer, you get negative points. This makes you go back to 
read the notes/paper/book to better under the contents.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: Can you explain again how does each HW get graded?<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
For each question, all correct answers add up to 100%. All incorrect answers add 
up to -100%. The score weighting for each correct answer is [100% / total number 
of correct answers]. The score weighting for each incorrect answer is [-100% / 
total number of correct answers]. The maximum score for each question is 100% if 
you pick all the correct answers and you did not pick any incorrect answers. The 
minimum score for each question is 0. Therefore the score you get for each 
question will be: Max { score for all correct answers + score all incorrect 
answers, 0 }</p>

<b>Midterm and Final</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: Will exams be live online or take home?
<br>A: Take home.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: How much time do I have to complete the exam?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
A: You have one week; just like the HW<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: What's the format of Midterm/Final?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
They are multiple-choice questions (like the HW). But for each question, you 
pick the BEST answer; you select ONE answer only. I assume this is easier than 
HW.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<b>Project</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: Will there be any projects?
<br>A. Yes.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<b>Grades and Solutions</b><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: 
When can I see my HW grade?
<br>A: It will be posted approximately three days after the HW due date.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: Can I see the solution for each HW?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
There is a way to look back what you did in your HW and what should be the right 
answer. (a) Log on to Moodle; (b) Click the course; This brings you to the course 
home page; (c) Click HW/Exam; This brings you to the HW/Exam list; (d) For the 
HW you completed/submitted, you can not click the HW anymore; But click 
“Completed”; This bring you to a page showing your score, the time spent; Please 
click Attempt Number “1”; (e) Now you see the HW you did and what should be the 
right answer. 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Q: 
Will grades for project and final exam posted?
<br>A: Grades for project and final exam will not be posted. Your overall grade 
for the course will be posted on Web for Students (not on Moodle) approximately 
one week after the final exam due date.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Q: &quot;Today I checked my grade for this course and it is not A. I did good in all 
HW. I got 100/100 in my all HW except one. I appreciate if you tell me why I did 
not get A.&quot;<br>
A: Your final is 65, which brings the grade down. Did you do all the HW 
yourself? Midterm and final are a lot simpler than HW's.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;
