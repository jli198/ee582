# **Do Your HW**

(1) You need to do your own HW, not copy from others. </br>
Doing HW is a good way to help you understand the course materials, help you get ready for the final exam. If you do not do your own HW, just copy from others, you will not learn much, your score for the final will be bad, and your overall grade for the course will not be good.

(2) Question from a student: "Today I checked my grade for this course and it is not A. I did good in all HW. I got 100/100 in my all HW except one. I appreciate if you tell me why I did not get A." </br>
Answer from the professor: "Your final is 65%, which brings the grade down. Did you do all the HW yourself? Midterm and final are a lot simpler than HW's."

(3) Copying HW solutions from others is wrong. </br>
Sharing your HW solutions and let others copy yours are also wrong.
